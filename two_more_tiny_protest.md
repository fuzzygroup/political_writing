# Two More Tiny Protests

Yesterday was my third day protesting at my local Tesla dealership. Two of those days I was all by myself -- just me and my sign in 15 degree weather. And, you know what, it mattered. 

Here are some of the good things that happened while I was standing with my sign:

* I noticed a car pass, slow enough to read my sign and then drive away. 10 minutes later she returned and handed me a hot chocolate. "Thank you for doing this, you looked cold so I got you something warm."
* A young woman pulled in next to me and thanked me. I then asked her if she wanted a sticker. I gave her one of my Swasticar stickers and asked her if she wanted a Cancel Tesla bumper sticker and she drove over to my car. Finally I got her phone number and sent her a text message to connect with our local 50501 resistance group. 
* I got to watch as the Tesla dealership staff had to route an 18 wheeler trying to deliver parts to them to an alternate entrance because "the CyberTruck that's blocking the entrance is dead and we can't move it; you have to go around; we just can't move it".
* A Tesla staffer came out and offered me hot coffee.  I thanked him and his comment to me was "I don't like Elon's politics.  I don't even think he should be in politics.  But I need to feed my family."  Engaging with the people around us, even when they are on the opposing side, is a skill we all need to learn.

Now there were also the bad things:

* A man in a Tesla stopped by and asked about my sign (which includes the infamous picture of Elon Musk doing a Sieg Heil).  He had the unmitigated gall to ask me "Why is that wrong?".  He trolled me for a little while and I finally said to him "I think we are ideologically divided and you should move on".
* Two men, in a large white pickup truck, drove past and shouted "I'll buy all the Swasticars I can.  Heil Hitler."

None of these interactions would have occurred if I hadn't been willing to do a tiny, one man protest.  And even the bad interactions are ones we can learn from.

Changing this current madness requires all of us to stand up.   Even you are going to be alone in your protest, I'd encourage you to pick up your sign and stand up.  Minds are changed one interaction at a time and it is time to start.

**Note**: When all of this madness started, my wife and I made up stickers against Tesla. Having swag to give out is powerful as it enables interactions. As an example, last night, my son asked for McDonalds. And I used that swag to engage with my order taker.  He gave me a fist bump and took 2 -- "I'll put them on my Dad's Tesla".   Swag is actually cheap to produce using services like StickerMule.
