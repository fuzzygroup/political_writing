# Even Tiny Protests Matter

Scott Johnson

Today I spent an hour alone holding an anti Tesla sign outside our local Tesla dealership. Ultimately a few other people showed up but I still consider it a success. And I'd have considered it a success even if no one else showed. Let me tell you why.

Right now we are at a unique inflection point in American history. Today is analogous to the civil rights protests of the 1960s or the women's rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The forces arrayed against us are vast and Americans need to rediscover how to peacefully protest. We either learn to peacefully protest or things will get very, very bad.

One very important thing that I learned is that protesting is a learned skill and like all learned skills, practice helps. I am braver now than I was before I went to my tiny protest. I am more confident now. And, in the interests of candidness, today was my third protest. We all learn by doing.

As I stood outside the Tesla dealership holding my sign, I made people going in uncomfortable. I could tell they were uncomfortable by their inability to look me in the eye, the ashamed look downward as they glided past in their Teslas or the angry comments they made at me. This was a win.

My sign was a piece of poster board with a blow up of Elon giving the Sieg Heil on national television with the artwork for my Don't Buy a Swasticar sticker. Everyone going past had to see the maker of their car doing a Sieg Heil. The people taking their children in had to explain it to them.

Here are some of the things I said to people:

* Americans used to fight Nazis. We don't buy their cars.
* Why would you want to drive a WankPanzer (to the CyberTruck folks)
* Please sell your Tesla; Don't support Elon

Figuring out the verbiage that will help your cause isn't easy but being in the right situation helps. My "Americans used to fight Nazis. We don't buy their cars" was completely improvised and, I think, quite good. I wouldn't have figured that out sitting at home. I needed to be on the front lines to figure that out.

While I was standing with my sign, a young man named Isaac from the University of Indiana at Bloomington stop by and said thank you. I asked him if he could hold a sign for just a little while and he said yes and stood with us for 15 minutes. I would never have thought about asking someone to help for just 15 minutes if I wasn't there. Now I know.

Another young man named Jamal came over to us and said "I hate Elon Musk" and then he left because he had to go to work. I should have given him some of my anti Tesla stickers and next time I will.

Other protestors, Stephanie and William, showed up and when one didn't have a sign, I gave her a sign that I made.

I should note that it wasn't all roses. A few people gave us the finger. One person trolled us with a ridiculous conversation. Two idiots in a giant white pickup truck shouted that they'd buy all the Swasticars they could and then Heil Hitler. And, you know what, it didn't matter. We still made a difference today.

My thanks go out to Stephanie, William, Isaac and Jamal and all the people who waved, gave thumbs up and honked their horns in support.
