All.  I'm posting less and less right now and that doesn't mean that I'm not active.  

Yesterday I was officially confimed as State Organizer for Indiana for 50501 by 50501 National.  I had the baton passed to me on March 7 but it took until yesterday for vetting to be completed and things to be official.  Other than my usual anti-Tesla, anti-Trump postings, I've held back on making much of official pronouncements because, perhaps, they might not have approved of me.

I'm posting less right now because we're organizing furiously.  And my effort is going into things that I haven't been able to talk about but now I can.

Yesterday Indiana 50501 made its first strategic move -- we now have a leader for our veterans.  Brian Jonasen, one of our speakers on 3/14 and 3/15 agreed to take on the responsibility of organizing our veterans in the state under the 50501 banner.

The previous organizational strategy I talked about in speeches at 3/15 was one of geography -- organize at the State (done), Congressional District (in process) and Town level (not really started at all; call me; I want to talk to you ðŸ˜‰).  And then the many speeches from our 3/14 pop up protest really affected me.  I looked at what Blythe Potter said, what Amy XXX said and I thought about our administration.  And I grew increasingly enraged.  Our veterans signed up to serve under a bargain that included things like the VA.  Now an administration, headed by a draft dodger and the richest man in the world have seen fit to radically cut the benefits that they earned.  Both Donald Trump and Elon Musk never met a contract they didn't want to renegotiate after the fact.  Our veterans deserve better.  They deserve to be treated honorably just as they served honorably.

By appointing a Veterans Organizer, we hope to rally all veterans in Indiana under the 50501 banner.  We believe that this accomplishes two things:

1. It will unite them and give them a better ability to push back collectively on the administration.  We all know collective action is powerful but let's push that needle even further.
2. 50501 is a peaceful, non violent movement, full stop.  We do not tolerate or allow violence in any way.  We want our veterans to know this for one simple reason: We want them to tell their brothers and sisters in arms who are still serving.  

Although 50501 is a non violent movement, we have started to see echoes of violence here in Indiana -- by the Braun administration.  Yesterday's removal of Christina Smith was shameful.  And that was done by the police.  

What happens when the National Guard is called out when we move larger and larger groups of people to peacefully protest?

It is our sincere hope that by joining with our veterans that our nation's military will be informed, in advance, that they have nothing to fear from 50501.

I could tell you more about Brian Jonasen:

1. I could tell you about the affecting speech he gave on 3/15 focused on his oath of service and how the majority of our government officials have violate that same oath.
2. I could tell you about his 30 year career in the Air Force including serving in the Pentagon.
3. I could tell you about his stepping up to help us -- when he was already comfortably retired

But, I won't.  What I will tell you is that I picked Brian Jonasen because he is simply a good and honorable human.

Brian's first protest is Tuesday 3/18 in Noblesville where he will be participating in the Take Back Our Rights protest:â€¨â€¨'TAKE BACK
