# Franchise the Revolution: Protest in a Box

Here at Indiana 50501, we want to make our Protest Organizers **more effective**.  And, to that end, we are now introducing something new:

> Protest in a Box

Or as we call it, **Franchise the Revolution**.

## What is a Franchise

The idea behind franchising was really simple: people wanted to have their own business but didn't want to start from scratch.  This led to existing businesses assembling all the tools and learnings for a new franchisee to easily succeed.  We'd like to do the same thing for **protest organizers**.

## How Does a Franchise Make Political Activism Easier?

With a half dozen protests under our belt, the Indianapolis side of 50501 is now making events pretty easily.  But we had to figure out literally everything from scratch.  We don't want our fellow organizers to have to start from nothing so we developed *Protest in a Box*, a collection of everything you need to run a protest.  

## What's In Your Protest Box?

Your Protest in a Box consists of the following things:

* A rechargeable speaker and microphone (different varieties will be used until we find the right one)
* A bucket of swag, for now, fidget spinners with various anti Trump / anti Tesla /  pro Democracy / pro Woman slogans
* A tote box of supplies

The purpose of the speaker is obvious -- it makes you louder.  

The bucket of swag is full of fidget spinners which can be given away with a couple of messages:â€¨
* All of us on the left have been in a state of constant anxiety since the Inauguration.  Fidget spinners give our hands something to do
* It makes people happy to look down and see Impeach Trump in my hands
* Fidget spinners give a way to talk to people -- if they react positively to it, you know their alignment

## The Tote Box of Magic Supplies

The tote box that you have been given has a lot of things in it.  Here are the purpose of each:

* Literature.  Each literature pack has current information about what's going on.  This is a combination of post cards and 8.5x11 printed materials.

Literature will need to be updated after each protest.

These things designate you as the person in charge.

* High Viz Vests.  There are two vests in each tote box.  These go on you and your helper (if you have one).  The idea here is that they make you visible to others.
* A safety whistle to go around your neck.  
* A clipboard and pens.  Alas there is no paper in your box at present.
* Megaphone. A small megaphone still packs a large punch.
* A pocket air horn.  This is included for your protection.  Should a counter protestor start harassing you, blowing the airhorn should make them leave.

Miscellaneous things:

* Two bottles of water / 3 snacks.  Protesting is surprisingly stressful.  This is for you for when the rush wears off and you crash (it really happens).  
* Two clickers for counting positive and negative feedback.  Give these to people and tell them click once for good or bad feedback (give them to two **different** people; one for good feedback and one for bad feedback).  Each day record the number of positive feedbacks versus negative feedbacks.  Ultimately we will use this to gauge if our efforts are working.
* Duct tape.  Duct tape is always useful.
* American Flag.  The symbolism of an American flag in distress is powerful
* A backup box of fidget spinners.
* A box of safety whistles.  These are very popular with women.
* A trash bag to pickup after the event
* A battery to charge your phone with all three commonly used cables handy.

You'll notice we didn't include a speaker stand.  That's deliberate because we've had issues with speakers falling and hitting people.  Until we resolve that, we won't.

## Conclusion

The very idea of **franchising the revolution** is perhaps silly on its face.  This is particularly true for the use of the term franchise which has such inherent business overtones.  And while business concepts are generally derided in an activism context, I would argue that we need to steal good ideas from the world of business and use them ethically.

But I'm going to push back on that -- franchising has literally changed tens if not hundreds of thousands of lives for the better.  Franchising isn't inherently negative -- it is the ethical violations associated with business that is an issue.

With Franchise the Revolution, we have assembled all the things a protest organizer needs.  Ultimately to reach the goal of mobilizing 3.5% of the American population, we need not tens of protests but thousands of protest.  Hence the need to franchise the revolution.
