# The Case Against Elon Musk

Elon Musk, both the richest man in the world and the richest man in human history, is a divisive figure. Great wealth is not a crime but Elon Musk's recent move into federal service marks his descent into actual criminality.   The basic thesis of this document is that Elon Musk's actions, while permissible in a private, corporate environment, are actually illegal in the context of the Federal government.  Since the moment the second Trump administration took office, Elon has rampaged across the Federal landscape as if he was engaged in a hostile take over.  And while hostile take overs are legal in a corporate setting, the actions that Elon has engaged in are distinctly illegal in a government context.

Perhaps Elon Musk is simply ignorant of the law, perhaps not, but in the U.S., ignorance of the law is not a defense against the committing of crimes.

Although Elon Musk's crimes are many, they can be broken down as follows:

* Violations of the CFAA
* Violations of Federal Employment Practices Related to Firing
* Violations of Federal Bonus Laws 
* Dismantling of Government Agencies Without Congressional Approval

## Violations of the CFAA 

The CFAA or Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is a US law that criminalizes accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization. The CFAA was passed in 1986 to address computer hacking. 

Elon Musk and his team of DOGE hackers -- all private individuals sourced from Elon Musk's companies or social circles have been described as accessing federal computers, hooking up their own storage devices and making copies of data.  Their actions have included verbal abuse of government employees to get access to the most intimate of federal systems.  How is that a violation of the CFAA ? 

See TechDirt ["In A Monday Night Declaration, The White House Admits Musk And DOGE Violated The CFAA (Although They Might Not Realize It)"](https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/18/in-a-monday-night-declaration-the-white-house-admits-musk-and-doge-violated-the-cfaa-although-they-might-not-realize-it/)

## Violation of Federal Employment Practices Related to Firing

Federal employment practices have specific guidelines, outlined in writing and codified into law, related to the firing of employees.  Elon Musk as the head of DOGE has violated these guidelines by arbitrarily firing employees, asserting "poor performance" when the employees had spotless records and generally ignored the guidelines for how terminations are handled.  

## Violations of Federal Bonus Laws

When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he penned an infamous email with the subject line "A Fork in the Road" where he encouraged employees to quit and take a payout.  And, as a private individual, at a company he now owned, that is completely fine.  However he used that same strategy when he emailed buy out offers to all federal employees.  The problem here is that the money promised was not allocated by Congress and violates Federal laws about how employees are compensated.  So this is either a violation of Federal employment practices, because you can't pay employees the way he is proposing, or he is making a fraudulent claim to federal employees for which he would be personally liable (inducing people to quit by an inducement that is illegal is fraud).

## Dismantling of Government Agencies Without Congressional Approval

Government agencies do not magically come into being -- they are established by actual laws passed by Congress, approved by the Senate and then signed into existence by the President.  Similarly dismantling a government agency requires an actual law.  Instead we have Elon Musk seemingly as a lone actor dismantling USAID and the CFPB with the only justification being:

*CFPB RIP*

as a tweet from Elon Musk.

This is a violation of U.S. law.  Although Musk may have been directed to take these actions, they are still illegal.  The Nuremberg Trials established that following an illegal order is still a crime.

## Possible Defenses of Elon Musk

There are two possible defenses that I can see Elon Musk making:

* But Musk Isn't In Charge of DOGE
* But Trump Told Him to Do This

After four weeks of Elon Musk claiming to be the head of the DOGE organization and certainly representing himself as such in multiple public presentations, tweets and press releases, the White House has now walked that back and is now asserting that Elon Musk is simply a Presidential Advisor.  However, even when pressed for answers, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller was unable to answer who was actually in charge of DOGE.  It is my belief that this the White House trying to provide cover for Musk as they have realized the criminality of his actions.  Despite this Musk was and is clearly in charge of DOGE. 

Another possible defense against the underlying criminality of Elon Musk's actions is the "The President Told Me To Do This" argument.  While the U.S. President is now effectively immune to illegal acts per the 2024 Supreme Court ruling, that does not protect a subordinate who follows an illegal order.
