Introduction
â€¨Welcome to Take Back Your Government 2.0: A 21st Century Guide to Grass Roots Political Activism.

This book was written by Scott Johnson, the State Organizer for Indiana 50501, as a result of his learning political activism in a trial by fire fashion.  

## My Story

I used to be happily retired.  Now I am a full time political activist and I am honestly happier than I have ever been.  This is my story.

Like a lot of Americans, particularly successful Americans, I haven't paid much attention to politics during my life.  Yes I voted regularly but for myself,. politics was something that happened to other people.  I certainly didn't need it -- after all, the system worked for me.  And then came Trump 2.0.  I woke up on the morning after the election convinced that I would turn on the TV and see Kamala's smiling face.  Instead I found the other face and I felt like I had been punched in the gut.

From the election to the inauguration, I became increasingly concerned and my wife became utterly prescient about what was going to happen.  While I would argue that the overall system would reign Trump in, my wife said "Nope" and she was right, every single time.  Together, we doom scrolled, watched YouTube and learned the names and reputations of all the Senators and Congress Critters.  And our anxiety grew and grew with every pronouncement on Truth Social.

I've always been a writer so I started a SubStack, Trump Said What, which took every post on Truth Social and deconstructed it bit by bit.  This did not address by anxiety but it did teach me about the enemy.  I rediscovered Memeorandum and archive.ph, two essential tools in the news ecosystem.  As the inauguration approached, the grift became abhorrent with companies paying millions just to be there.  

On January 20, 2025, I and my fellow Americans watched as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai were seated in front of our government leaders, the duly elected Senators and Congress Critters.  More than anything else, this sent the message that Trump 2.0 would not be like Trump 1.0.  Watching Trump get sworn in and not even put his hand on the bible said to us and so many others that, again, it was bad.  

And then, right after the inauguration, came the the January 6th insurrectionist pardons.  And, no, I will not use the term "J6".  I watched the duly elected President free actual insurrectionists with the stroke of his pen and a smarmy grin.  We were revolted.

That was the moment when things changed for me.  I knew that I couldn't handle this by reading the news, posting on social media and waiting for someone else to solve things.

## Tesla

My background is as a software engineer and I've spent much of my career in and around Silicon Valley.  While I've never attained the level of fiscal success that pervades the valley, I've done well for myself and I retired early, during the pandemic.  While I did a little consulting on the side, a good bit of my time went to what I call good works: 

* Covid Near Me - I built one of the first Covid trackers and the first one to correlate stats right down to your county
* Pizza For Ukraine - A colleague and I built a Micro Charity that initially delivered pizzas to homes in Ukraine and now takes donations in pizza sized amounts and funds a soup kitchen

With these things under my belt and an earlier stint working for the ADL, the idea of my doing something about Trump 2.0 wasn't new to me although I didn't know what.

The more I looked at everything happening in Washington, the more I realized that Elon Musk was at the dead center of everything.  Both the richest man in the world and the richest man in human history, he had simply bought Trump the presidency.  Now the one thing I know about the rich and powerful is that mockery is the one thing they cannot abide.  Seeing an article about "Swasticar" stickers appearing in London, I tried to buy them but the $15 price per sticker on Etsy simply wasn't viable.  

But there was nothing stopping me from making my own stickers based on the images I found on the Internet.  A week later, courtesy of StickerMule, I had a box full of stickers and a plan.  I would go to our local grocery store and I would put stickers under the windshield wipers of Teslas.  Reading biography upon biography of Musk had taught me that he didn't take a salary from his businesses.  Instead Musk finances his lavish lifestyle with margin loans on the value of his stock.  

Now was I naive enough to think that one dude putting stickers under wipers in the middle of Indiana would even move the needle?  Of course not.  While I can be an idiot, generally speaking, I am not.  What I did think was that people all over the globe would do similar things.

As I write this, it is 50 odd days into Trump's presidency and all of the stock market gains that Tesla got since the election have been reversed and the overall market capitalization of Tesla has fallen by half.  That's hundreds of billions of dollars of value destroyed.  I'd like to think that I played a small part in it.

## 50501

Even the thrill of occasionally being naughty and putting the sticker on a Tesla (peel the back off, palm it in your hand and use a brush pass as you walk by, never stop and check) simply wasn't enough.

And then came 50501, the first time in my life that a simple succession of integers would change everything for me.  

50501 is an Internet organization that stands for "50 States, 50 Capitals, 1 protest".  It is a synchronized protest effort designed to wake people up.  I found out about 50501 somehow -- I can't even remember how -- and my wife and I trudged down to the Indiana State House on 2/5/25 in miserably cold weather.  We even had signs that we made from the backs of easel sized post it notes.  Mine was "Tesla" with a slash through it while hers was anti Trump.

What we watched was a very minimal protest.  All of us were freezing but we still marched, we chanted and we made some noise.  There was a leader, a man who had clearly pulled things together.  And I watched his actions.  What I saw was someone who appeared to be profoundly kind.  This man's name, I would come to learn, was Christian Hess.   

As the protest continued, I noticed that Christian had not only organized it but he had thought far enough ahead to buy water bottles and packets of trail mix.  And I saw people take these snacks and drinks and use it to fuel themselves to keep going.  The whole event went about two hours and I found that I was actually enjoying myself.  Holding up a sign and saying chant phrases like:

Hey Hey
Ho Ho
Donald Trump Has to Go

was oddly liberating.  It felt like I had found my tribe.  Within the next few weeks, I would know, without question, that I had found my tribe.  

As the event wrapped, I walked over to Christian, introduced myself and said "Hey man.  You shouldn't have to both run the event and pay for snacks.  That's not fair.  Here's some cash".  And I handed him $40 cash.  I also got his contact info so I could look him up after the event.

And that's how I entered the world of politics.

Within a month I found myself appointed State Organizer of Indiana for 50501 and being interviewed where I would boldly make statements like these:

"Our current administration has broken the law.  We are now in a constitutional crisis and we have to bring down a sitting President.  The solution is to invoke Chenoweth and get 3.5% of the population to protest.  That's 11.5 million in the U.S. and 288,000 here in Indiana".

It has been a wild ride and I've never been happier.  All of commercial success palls in comparison to the joy that I have found just helping people, giving speeches to a crowd of thousands (ok a crowd of 1,376 but it will be thousands) and marching in the streets.

## A Warning

This book will step on a number of sacred cows.  I'm not a politician.  I'm not entrenched in the current U.S. Republican vs Democrat thinking.  I'm a successful entrepreneur and software engineer turned full time activist.  I believe in winning decisively and using every management technique I learned over 40 years in high tech to do just that.  

In short, I believe that the very techniques used by the right can also be used by the left.  I term this "Move Fast and Break Things for Social Good".  

In the immortal stylings of Guy Kawaski, by the end of this book, I don't want you to be a reader, I want you to be a fan.

## About this Book's Title

One of my favorite authors was science fiction writer Robert Anson Heinlein.  Although there are issues with his works, I grew up on them and loved them.  One of his little known works was a political tract titled Take Back Your Government.  Although that books is wildly out of date (it begins with a reference to using a phone book), I love the title and have appropriated it accordingly.
