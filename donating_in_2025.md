# How to Spend Your Political Donations in 2025
America is currently in a  constitutional crisis and on the verge of authoritarian rule if not already under authoritarian rule (we just don't know it yet).  From the violation of the Impoundment Control Act to the illegal dismantling of underpinnings of our democratic way of life such as USAID, Trump has broken the law regularly since January 20, 2025 and the best that we can get from House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries is:

**We need to keep our powder dry**.

I'm sorry but Jeffries and the vast majority of Democratic politicians no longer deserve our money (AOC and Bernie are the exception and I've donated).

The traditional way to make a difference in American politics, for 99% of us, is simple: **we make a donation** and we tell ourselves that we **did our part**.  I no longer think that's correct and I'd like to start with a radical thesis:

The Democratic Party is **fundamentally broken** and **no longer** deserves the support of individual voters via financial contributions.

But that then raises the question as to how any of us actually make a difference.  I'm going to outline three ways that you can actually make a difference.  These approaches go from the most expensive to the least expensive because for most Americans, what you have for political purposes is money to donate and what you have the least of is time.

## Approach 1: Support a Lobbyist or Activist

Whenever you dig deep into politics, you always find the two words "lobbyist" and "activist" tossed around.  But what do these terms even mean?

Let's start with a definition of **lobbyist**:

*A lobbyist is a person or organization that tries to influence government action on behalf of a client or employer. Lobbyists can use written or oral communication, or try to gain the favor of a government official. *

Hm... I don't see anything there that indicates that you need special skills to be a lobbyist.  Anyone can be a lobbyist.

And let's look at the meaning of **activist**:

*An activist is a person who campaigns for social or political change. Activists may use strong actions, such as protests, strikes, or sit-ins, to achieve their goals. *

Again I don't see anything there that indicates you need special skills to be an activist.  Anyone can be an activist.

At the heart of any type of activism / lobbying work is nothing more than a person who works to get a particular point of view expressed in a way that the people that determine things see it.  As far as I can see it, the things that are important are:

* The person has to care
* The person has to have good people skills
* The person, ideally, has good computer skills
* The person has to have good communication skills
* The person has to understand the political landscape

The 50501 movement is something new that is organizing protests nationwide under the mantra of 50 states, 50 capitals, 1 protest.  Now the 50501 movement is being largely coordinated online.  One of the things that I am seeing here in Indiana is the emergence of people in what you might call **connector** roles.  These are people who are pulling the community together, moderating discussions, soothing ruffled feathers.  That to me is an activist.  They are actively pulling the community together.

The problem facing these people is that they have effectively taken on a second job with all this.  And, at the end of the day, these people have to be able to feed their families.  I am seeing a real risk of burnout and over work.

But what if **you** could support an activist / lobbyist.  I mean that is what the billionaires do.  They support people to go out and help make the change they want happen.  Why can't the little guy do that?

I would make the proposal that the people we are seeing emerging that are pulling these communities together at actually the **next generation** of lobbyists / activists.

Here are a few possibilities:

* If you're well enough off in America, there isn't any reason why you can't spend say $30,000 to $40,000 to support someone for a year's worth of activism work.  Yes I know that at the low end of the economic scale that seems like a huge amount but America has tons of wealthy people both Republican and Democrat.  
* If you're not well enough off, could you band together with friends to combine funds to support someone?  Four people each contributing a $10,000 amount is enough to support someone full time.
* If you can't afford to support someone full time, could you put together the funding to support someone part time?  Or could you and your friends band together and support someone part time.

It should be noted that support may actually be non-monetary.  If you watch an activist's kids so they can goto a protest, that's support.  If you drive a group of protestors to a rally because they don't have a car, that's support.  Cooking them a meal or giving them a place to hold a meeting is support.

In closing, by supporting a lobbyist or activist, you free them up to focus on the current crisis.  They will be able to devote all their energy to this problem.

## Approach 2: Sponsor and Artist and Give them Direction

Say what you will about art but art makes people stop and think.  And by art I don't necessarily mean paintings -- I mean imagery that makes people realize what is going on.  Artists can make **memes**.  Memes can go viral and change people's thinking.  If you haven't seen the 0 to 1939 image of a Tesla illustrating Musk's descent into fascism, [click here](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/elon-musk-poster-london-tesla-sales-drop-1236147614/).  An artist made that.  And I'll be they weren't paid to do it -- they did it because they thought it was the right thing to do.

Art that makes fun of Trump, makes fun of Musk is powerful.  One thing the rich and powerful hate is ridicule.  Let's make them squirm.  Let's make art so powerful that their kids will ask them "Hey Daddy, why does everyone hate you".

But what if you found a local artist and worked with them to get political art made that reflects the points you care about.  If you're a veteran and you're beyond angry about cuts to the VA then get that art made.  Work to distribute it. 

And don't tell me you don't know any artists.  Artists are all around us -- talk to your kid's art teacher, go to a local community college and ask a professor for a talented student.  Find someone selling crafts at a farmer's market.  If they can't do it then they'll know someone.

Given that people are currently doing this for free as a side gig, imagine would could happen if they got some money.

Let's bring back some individual patronage of the arts.  We don't have to be Medici to make this happen.  From the artists I've talked, you can probably pay for art like this literally in pizza.

## Approach 3: Get Your Hands Dirty and Spend Your Money Yourself

Let me ask you a question.  Let's say that you want to donate $250 to a politician, say, Hakeem Jeffries.  Do you really feel that if you were to donate that $250 to him, that it would make a difference?  I've thought about it -- a lot -- and I don't think so.

Now let me ask you a different question. Do you feel that if you took that $250 and spent it yourself that you could make a difference?

That's what I actually believe.  That I can take the money that I would've donated to a Democratic politician, and I can spend it myself in a more effective fashion than donating it to the existing people. 

And, rather than just be an Internet blowhard, I've put my money where my mouth is and I'm doing this myself, right now and over the past month.

In my case, I've made the decision to get involved with the [Indiana branch of the 50501](https://bit.ly/indy50501) movement and what I've done is now printed 2,000 post cards to get people to our rallies and to get people to the 2/28, 3/7 and 3/14 online protests.  In small batches, 1,000 post cards costs about $215 from Fedex Office.  And I go out into my community and put them under windshields in local supermarket parking lots.

Now, yes, this does require me to get my hands dirty.  I actually have to:

1. Figure out a message.  Or steal one online which is easy.
2. Design a post card; this is actually easy using Canva.
3. Print it via Fedex; again this is easy and can be done online.
4. Pick up the postcards and pay for them.
5. Walk around a parking lot and put them under windshields.

My initial expectation was that this would be hard and intimidating but it actually isn't.  You can stick postcards under windshields in a large parking lot at about the rate of 200 per hour.  

So I'm doing this work but what if I want to do more?  There are only so many hours in the day and that brings us back to the other approaches.  Want to do more but don't have the time, consider approach #1 or approach #2.

## Others Think This Too

I'm apparently not the only one thinking about how to spend political dollars differently.  [Sarah Kendzior](https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/your-questions-answered-were-already?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1n8b7d&triedRedirect=true) has similar thoughts:

My advice here is do not wait for elections. Do not give money to politicians; give it to groups and people who you know are helping others. Many Americans are barely getting by. In order for people to participate in politics, basic material needs must be met. Work to improve and protect your community or focus on whatever causes interest you. Also, it’s fine to take breaks or concentrate on small efforts: if everyone does something small, bigger changes will happen. But do not rely on people with a track record of betrayal.

## Conclusion

What I am positing is a radical restructuring of how American individuals approach their political donations.  It requires a lot more individual work by Americans but I think that's a very good thing.  Americans have been generally disconnected from the political process for a long time now and Donald Trump is the end result of people taking their eye off the game.

In closing, one way to look at my proposal is that what I'm saying is:

* Anarchic
* Uncoordinated
* Decentralized

And I'd totally agree with that.  It is all of those things.  But the current centralized approach to politics is what got us here.  Do we really think that the existing system is actually working?  I don't and I'm spending my time and my money on all these approaches.
