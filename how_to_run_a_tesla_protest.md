# How To Run a Tesla Protest 

I've now been doing daily Tesla protests for over a week, which, incredibly, makes me an old hand at this.  üòÇ üòÜ üòù  I thought it might be useful for me to write out how I run my tiny Tesla protests in a step by step fashion.  I've had as few as 1 person protesting (me) and as many as 4.  And, surprisingly, these were still effective:

* People stop and talk to us; raising awareness is a key part of protesting.  People see you doing it and they get a tiny bit braver to do it themselves.
* People bring you things; I've now had two people see me and come back with hot chocolate and hot tea (I was out there in 15 degree weather)
* People honk in support
* People wave
* People give thumbs up
* People blink their lights

## Here's what I do to run a Tesla protest:

1. Find your local Tesla dealership and drive by, studying the layout.  Note a place where you can stand where you aren't breaking the law by impeding their business.  In my case I stand just off the property on grass in front of the dealership.  Everyone that drives by can see me and they have to drive past me to go in.  Make sure that it is a safe place to stand for an hour or two.
2. Pick a time on your schedule when you can do it **repeatedly**.  You don't have to be the nut that I am be out there 6 days a week but repetition builds awareness.  One example is you pick every Saturday from 12 to 1.  Make it something that your personal schedule allows for as, right now, it is only you.  Saturdays are good days because people have time off work.
3. Goto [TESLA TAKEDOWN](https://www.teslatakedown.com/) and register your protest.  This will help make other people aware of it.
4. Post the link to your protest event on your socials whether Facebook, Insta, BlueSky, Twitter or something else.  Let other people know as much as you can.
5. Post about your event whether the link, a picture of your sign or a write up about it.  Keep in mind that social media often seems to deliver things to people AFTER the event has happened (Thanks Zuck) so posting about it repeatedly maximizes the chance that your friends see it.
6. If you have close friends, don't just put it on your socials, text them personally.
7. Make your sign.  Make multiple signs.  I now have about 15 signs in my car on the off chance that someone new shows up (and yes it has happened).  My sign has a picture of Elon doing the Sieg Heil and then blown up pictures of my "Don't Buy a Swasticar" stickers.  Put on your sign why you're protesting.
8. Practice your talking points.  You need to be coherent, rational and not angry.  My point is basically "Yes Teslas are lovely cars.  It is a pity that the owner of the company is an unelected bureaucrat who is currently cutting essential social programs that Americans rely on".  I also use the line "Americans used to fight Nazis now we buy their cars.  That's just wrong".  And my points aren't necessarily the best; find what works for you. I used to do a lot of public speaking and the key is practice.  Just as I used to rehearse in hotel suite bathrooms, I'm doing it again only at home.
9. On the day of the event post again and make sure it is the top post in your stream.  Don't post anything else until the event is over.
10. On the day of the event, look in the mirror and realize you need to be **brave**.  Standing in front of a business with a sign protesting them is an act of bravery and defiance.  I've had people yell "F You", give me the finger and, once, "Heil Hitler".  Know in advance that you're going to face pushback.  
11. Pack a snack and a bottle of water.  Protesting feels like it should be easy but it really isn't.
12. Show up at the right time, dressed for the weather and hold your sign.  Don't forget your gloves!  Be ready to talk to people.
13. After the protest, go on your socials and write about it.  Talk about the experience.
14. Go back to [TESLA TAKEDOWN](https://www.teslatakedown.com/) and register your next protest.

## Bonus Round - Make Swag

Before I ever started protesting, my wife and I made Don't Buy a Swasticar stickers and I'd walk around my local supermarket parking lot, putting them under the windshield of Teslas.  That was my first bit of anti-Tesla swag.  Now I have:

* Don't Buy a Swasticar stickers
* Bumperstickers that say www.canceltesla.org
* Postcards highlighting upcomingonline protests (mine include 2/28 (no purchasing), March 7-14 (no amazon), March 14 (general strike))
* Small 3d printed dragons

The last one bears some explaining since there isn't an obvious connection to Tesla.  In my experience with people when you can reach out to someone's child, they remember it.  People **love** their kids.  I ask everyone that stops "May I ask if you have a small child in your life?".  If they answer yes then I give a dragon.  If the child is present then I let the child pick the one he likes.  Protesting is about building connections between people as much as it is about holding a sign.  And any way you can reach some is fair game, imho.

You don't have to have swag but it really does help.  Maybe even just a one page flier you print out at home.  Someone actually asked me what the issue was with Elon and it forced me to write [The Case Against Elon Musk](https://bit.ly/caseagainstelonmusk).  Print it out if you like, nothing would make me happier (disclaimer I am not a lawyer).  

**Sidebar**: My wife has a three d printing business.  I have an infinite supply of dragons.  Soon I'll have anti-Tesla fidget spinners also.
