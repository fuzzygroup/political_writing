# The Nerds Will Not Save You (Or Us)

I saw someone online crying out for "Oh Tech Nerds Please Save Us".  I think that she as looking for a Musk like figure to rise up and liberate us from the current, impending fascism.

No, no dear reader -- **THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN**.  There is no tech overlord coming to save you from the Big Bad Musk.  There might, however, be a new tech overlord coming to pick up the reins from Musk...

I am a tech nerd, a multiple time entrepreneur (albeit one on the mini level of fiscal success rather than the big level of fiscal success).  I have worked in Silicon Valley.  I have founded a company in Silicon Valley.  I have raised money from the PayPal mafia.  I can actually that say I know and, more importantly, **understand** these people.

Once upon a time,  I founded a Silicon Valley company when I lived here in Indianapolis and I commuted back and forth from Indianapolis to San Francisco on a half time basis for roughly 3 years.  That unique experience gave me a very different understanding of Silicon Valley.  Fundamentally I never gave in and drank the kool aid.  I would go home every two weeks and live in the real world.  My fundamental learning from 3 years of that experience was this:

**In Silicon Valley culture when the amount of money is high enough, there is no moral compromise that those will will not make**

The reason for this is that Silicon Valley is about the creation of **generational wealth**.  And when you can look at your life in terms of "If I do this one bad thing, my kids might never need to work", it is trivial to **justify** almost any action.

**Disclaimer**: I have bitterness here because I was a company founder who was fired by the board members I hired and then I watched from the sidelines while they drove my company out of business.  I take much joy in knowing that I was the only one out of that business who actually made any money.  Those earnings paid for my first house in Indianapolis.

Another way to look at Silicon Valley is that culturally it is very similar to Los Angeles.  The difference is that where as in Los Angeles, everyone has a screen play, in Silicon Valley, everyone has a startup.  Now the difference is that while a screen play might sell for $50,000, a startup might sell for $50 million.

The reason why no tech overlord is coming to save you is simple -- there is no money in it.  Yes you might have a Mark Cuban who sits on the sidelines and snipes at the administration but he isn't going to fundamentally endanger his fortune by taking on the administration.  Ultimately we, the people, will have to save ourselves.

Looking at this through the long lens of history, it is pretty clear to me that a few things are going on.

1. Trump and musk will actually fail at all this and **lose**. There simply are too many of us and two few of them.
2. The reason your Senators and Congress {eople aren't responsive is that they've been bought off somehow. Perhaps it is explicit bribes / promises of power.  Perhaps it is fear of losing the next election.  Perhaps it is fears of person security.  I don't know how but Senators and Congress People take oaths of office to the US Constitution and yet they are in flagrant violation of their oath. I can't explain that unless they've been bought off. 
3. Trump, musk Vance, etc. are all guilty of actual crimes now. They won't stop until the government is brought down. None of them want to go to jail. 
4. The point of getting out there and raising protest signs is to find both find your people and to get the population that's asleep awake. In 50501 I have found my people and it is glorious. 

Yes protest signs aren't going to cut it alone, but they are the start. This isn't something that tech nerds solve. Heck tech nerds caused this. This is something that the American populace solves through collective action.
