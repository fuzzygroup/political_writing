# Replacing USAID By The U.S. Citizens

Someone asked online about replacing USAID with citizen based donations and I did some rough math. The key thing here is to understand how insanely large a billion dollars is much less 60 billion. It's very hard to replace a government agency with citizen action. 

If a portion of the American people support the mission of USAID then why canâ€™t WE donate the money to FUND it? Serious question.

My math isn't perfect but I think it is illustrative. 

* The budget of USAID was 60 billion. 
* Assume 330 million people in U.S. 
* Assume 1/2 country is maga so 1/2 won't help

* Assume 165 million democrats 
* Assume household size of 3 people
* Leaves 55 million house holds
* That means every household has to donate $1090

And you won't get 100%. If only 50% support this then each household has to donate $2200. That's a lot of money.   Now if you then break it down to $2200 / 52, that's $42 per week.  And while that doesn't seem like a lot to me, you'd need to do the analysis as to what it means to most people -- I suspect that it would be very hard.

And just having the funds isn't the same as having the infrastructure that a 60 year old agency. Money is only part of the problem.  Just as an example, a random group of citizens can't buy AIDS drugs.
