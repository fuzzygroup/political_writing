# Protestor Economics

I'm now at my fourth protest (Trump / Musk / Tesla / ICE)  in two weeks and someone said something to me the other day that was scary: 

*The civil rights protests lasted 14 years*.

I'm 57 now so I really didn't live through that era but watching the embryonic community around the 50501 protests here in Indiana has made me think a lot about the *economics* of being a protestor, specifically a *protest organizer*.

I'm watching the activities in our online and real world community here and I'm seeing the enormous amount of effort that people are expending to organize protest things.  This includes the real world activities (getting a permit, buying stuff, rallying the troops, etc) and the online things (keeping the community engaged, making web pages, soothing ruffled feathers, identifying and booting trolls, etc).  

What I've noticed is the protest organizers now have effectively picked up a second or third job.

And that concerns me because it is a second or third *unpaid* job.  

I think its clear by now that Trump, Musk need to go but we don't know when that's going to happen.  This might be a 2026 thing.  It might be a 2028 thing.  It might be longer.  For all any of us know, we could be in an armed rebellion by March.  Or we might just be stuck in an authoritarian hellscape for years.  And, sadly, the years thing is probably more likely.

It occurs to me that perhaps we need a model for *protest organizer economics*, a way for people who are doing the very real and very hard work of making this all happen to get some compensation for their labor.

At my very first protest, I made sure to find the person who ran it and give him some cash for the snacks and water he was thoughtful enough to bring.  And, yeah, what I did was kind but I don't think it is really scalable.  Just the scarcity of cash in most people's hands today is an issue.  

But what if we used *SubStack* as a payment model.  A substack is a web page where you can publish anything -- words, pictures, videos, audio files.  What if your protest organizer set one up where they said:

"I'm XYZ and I help run the ABC Protesting.  You know me.  You met me at a protest.  You interact with me in the group chat.  If you subscribe to this, you can see a weekly summary and opt into one of the payment plans to support my efforts."

My understanding of SubStack, while limited, is that you can set up different tiers of payment level. This would let a protest organizer set up say:

* $5 / month
* $10 / month
* $20 / month
* $50 / month
* $100 / month 

By allowing people to opt into a payment plan that suits their ability to pay, we might be able to build a sustainable economic model for protest organizers.

**Disclaimer**: I'm successful and retired.  I'm not writing this because I need or want it.  I'm writing this because I'm worried about the burnout people are going to suffer from.  Right now we are in the early enthusiasm stage of Trump resistance but this is going to be a long slog and I don't want to lose people along the way.
